# Where should first X tty be spawned?
xtty=7

# Restrict tty? (By default, cdm increments X tty, this setting
# allows administrators to lock users into one specific tty by
# setting the display=N option on a per-user basis.)
locktty=no

# Enable login shell (fixes issues with some keymaps, uses bash).
# Note that your bash scripts won't have any terminal as stdin when
# started in this way. This may break some commands, including stty,
# unless you explicitly check for [ -t 0 ] or that every login shell
# is also interactive. However, we're sending stdout and stderr to
# /dev/null, so you won't see the complaints.
loginshell=no

# The use of consolekit has recently become manditory with hal. However,
# some users might prefer not using either one. If you don't want to
# use consolekit, set the following variable to "no".
consolekit=yes

# Timeout for waiting for X session to register with consoleKit
consolekittime=30

# Additional arguments to pass to X server
# When usexinit=yes, we use ~/.xinitrc when it exists or /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
# when it doesn't. These are passed the chosen window manager as $1; note that
# the stock /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ignores this and always starts twm and three
# xterms. Your custom xinitrc should start the window manager supplied as $1
# instead. There is a sample xinitrc included at /usr/share/cdm/xinitrc.skel.
# If usexinit=no, then we instead call the chosen window manager directly.
usexinit=no

# Additional arguments to pass to X server; it will be called as:
#	exec /usr/bin/X :$display $serverargs vt$((xtty+display))
