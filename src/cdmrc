# (An example:)

#   '/bin/bash --login'              # or just execute your shell,
#   '/usr/bin/fbterm'                # or start a frame buffer console,
#   '/usr/bin/cdm ~/.submenu.cdmrc'  # or go to a submenu :)
# )

# List all program display names, one-by-one matched with $binlist.
# Names with whitespaces should be quoted or escaped.
#
# (Continued example:)

# Type of the programs, one-by-one matched with $binlist.
# `C' for *C*onsole programs, which would be `exec'ed.
# `X' for *X* programs, which would be run with cdm-xlaunch(1).
#
# (Continued example:)
# flaglist=(X C C C)

# Style for the cdm dialog, which is printed with dialog(1).
# Default to unset, causing dialog(1) to use the system wide default.
# See /usr/share/doc/cdm/themes for some nice choices.

# Alternative method of calling startx(/setsid). Should only be set if cdm
# does not start X as expected (bash -x shows call to setsid startx, but for
